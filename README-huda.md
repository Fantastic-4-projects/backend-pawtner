# Development Notes by Gemini CLI (Huda's Branch)

This document summarizes the changes made by the Gemini CLI agent related to authentication, security, and email verification.

## 1. New Features and Modules Implemented

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implemented core authentication and authorization functionalities using Spring Security and JWT.
- **Email Verification**: Added email verification flow for new user registrations.
- **Admin User Initialization**: Added a mechanism to create an admin user on application startup.
- **Business Profile Management**: Implemented features for creating and viewing business profiles, with role-based access control.

## 2. File Changes and Additions

### New Files:

- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/config/AdminInitializer.java`: Initializes the admin user.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/controller/BusinessController.java`: REST controller for managing business profiles.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/dto/request/BusinessRequestDTO.java`: DTO for business registration requests.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/dto/response/BusinessResponseDTO.java`: DTO for business profile responses.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/repository/BusinessRepository.java`: Repository for business profile operations.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/service/BusinessService.java`: Interface for business profile services.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/service/impl/BusinessServiceImpl.java`: Implementation of `BusinessService`.

### Modified Files:

- `pom.xml`: Added `hibernate-types-60` dependency for JSON mapping.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/config/SecurityConfig.java`: Enabled method-level security (`@EnableMethodSecurity`) to allow for role-based authorization on controller methods and configured CORS.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/constant/UserRole.java`: Added `ADMIN` role to support administrative privileges.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/controller/AuthController.java`: Added input validation (`@Valid`) and improved user-facing response messages.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/dto/request/RegisterRequestDTO.java`: Updated to include `phoneNumber` and `address` fields for more complete user profiles.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/entity/Business.java`: Refactored `operationHours` to use `Map<String, String>` with `JsonType` for better structure and updated column definitions for `description` and `address`.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/entity/User.java`: Updated `address` column definition.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/repository/AuthRepository.java`: Added `existsByEmail` method to check for existing users during admin initialization.
- `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/service/impl/AuthServiceImpl.java`: Hardcoded new user registrations to the `CUSTOMER` role and added a check to prevent login for unverified accounts.

## 3. Conclusion

These changes introduce a robust authentication and authorization system with email verification, enhancing the security and user management capabilities of the Pawtner application. The addition of an admin role and business profile management features, secured by method-level authorization, provides a foundation for core application functionality. The migration of `Double` to `BigDecimal` for monetary and coordinate values improves precision and avoids floating-point inaccuracies.

## 4. Post-Implementation Refinements

Following the initial implementation, several refinements were made to improve consistency and address feedback:

- **`BusinessController.java`**: Removed `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")` from the `viewBusiness` endpoint to allow broader access and add endpoint in front `/api`.
- **`AuthController.java`**: add endpoint in front `/api`.
- **`BusinessRequestDTO.java`**: Renamed the `operationHour` field to `operationHours` for clarity and consistency.
- **`Business.java`**: Changed the `columnDefinition` for the `operationHours` field from `jsonb` to `TEXT` to simplify data handling.
- **`BusinessServiceImpl.java`**: Updated the `create` method to use `getOperationHours()` in alignment with the DTO changes.

## 5. Refactoring `operationHours`

To improve the structure and maintainability of how business operation hours are handled :

- **DTO and Converter**: Introduced `OperationHoursDTO` to replace the generic `Map<String, String>` and added a custom `OperationHoursConverter` to handle serialization to and from JSON in the database.
- **Dependency Removal**: Removed the `hibernate-types-60` dependency, favoring the custom converter for a more lightweight solution.
- **Codebase Update**: Updated the `Business` entity, DTOs, and service layer to utilize the new `OperationHoursDTO` and converter, ensuring a more robust and type-safe implementation.
