# Development Notes by Gemini CLI (Rifqi's Branch)

This document summarizes the initial review and setup steps performed by the Gemini CLI agent to prepare the project for further development.

## 1. Project Overview and Database Schema Review

- **`README.md`**: The main `README.md` was thoroughly reviewed. It provides a comprehensive and well-structured plan for the Pawtner application.
- **Conclusion**: The `README.md` serves as an excellent foundation for understanding the project's vision and technical direction.

## 2. Entity Class Review and Validation

All Java entity classes located in `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/entity/` were reviewed against the database schema defined in `README.md`.

**Correction Made:**
- **`User.java`**: The `name` field was identified as non-nullable in the database schema but lacked an explicit `nullable = false` in its `@Column` annotation. This was corrected.
- **`Service.java`**: The `imageUrl` field was missing and has been added.

## 3. Introduction of Enums for Type Safety

To enhance type safety and readability, several fields were converted from `String` types to custom Java `enum` types in the `com.enigmacamp.pawtner.constant` package.

## 4. Completed Development Tasks

Based on the MVP plan in `README.md`, the following core features have been fully implemented:

### a. Product Management (CRUD)
- **`ProductController`**: Exposes REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products.
- **`ProductService`**: Contains the business logic for managing products.
- **`ProductRepository`**: Handles data access for the `Product` entity.
- **DTOs**: `ProductRequestDTO` and `ProductResponseDTO` were created for handling data transfer.
- **Security**: Endpoints are secured, allowing only `business_owner` roles for modification operations.

### b. Service Management (CRUD)
- **`ServiceController`**: Exposes REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting services.
- **`ServiceService`**: Contains the business logic for managing services.
- **`ServiceRepository`**: Handles data access for the `Service` entity.
- **DTOs**: `ServiceRequestDTO` and `ServiceResponseDTO` were created for handling data transfer.
- **Security**: Endpoints are secured, allowing only `business_owner` roles for modification operations.

### c. Image Upload Service
- **`ImageUploadService`**: A reusable service for handling image uploads.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: The service is now configured to use Cloudinary for image storage.
- **Configuration**: Cloudinary credentials have been externalized to `application.properties` for better security and maintainability.

## 5. Next Steps

With the foundation for managing products and services now in place, the next logical steps are to implement the core e-commerce and booking workflows as defined in the MVP.

### a. Implement Shopping Cart Functionality
- Create `CartService` and `CartController` to allow customers to add products to a shopping cart.
- Implement logic for adding, removing, and clearing cart items.

### b. Implement Order and Checkout Process
- Create `OrderService` and `OrderController` to allow customers to convert their cart into an order.
- Implement the main `createOrderFromCart` method.

### c. Implement Payment Integration (Midtrans)
- Create `PaymentService` and `PaymentController`.
- Integrate with the Midtrans API to create transactions and handle webhooks.

### d. Implement Booking Functionality
- Create `BookingService` and `BookingController` to allow customers to book services.
- Implement logic for checking availability and creating bookings.
- Integrate with the `PaymentService` to handle payments for bookings.
