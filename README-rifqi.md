# Development Notes by Gemini CLI (Rifqi's Branch)

This document summarizes the initial review and setup steps performed by the Gemini CLI agent to prepare the project for further development.

## 1. Project Overview and Database Schema Review

- **`README.md`**: The main `README.md` was thoroughly reviewed. It provides a comprehensive and well-structured plan for the Pawtner application, including:
    - Executive Summary
    - Core Problem Statement
    - Proposed Solution & Core Features
    - Technical Architecture (with detailed Database Design and ERD)
    - Core User Workflows
    - Technical Specifications
    - MVP Execution Plan and Roadmap

    The `README.md` serves as an excellent foundation for understanding the project's vision and technical direction.

## 2. Entity Class Review and Validation

All Java entity classes located in `src/main/java/com/enigmacamp/pawtner/entity/` were reviewed against the database schema defined in `README.md`.

The following entity classes were checked:
- `Booking.java`
- `Business.java`
- `CartItem.java`
- `Order.java`
- `OrderItem.java`
- `Payment.java`
- `Pet.java`
- `Prescription.java`
- `PrescriptionItem.java`
- `Product.java`
- `Review.java`
- `Service.java`
- `ShoppingCart.java`
- `User.java`

**Findings:**
- The entity classes are generally well-implemented, with correct JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@ManyToOne`, `@OneToOne`, `@JoinColumn`).
- Relationships between entities are correctly defined.
- Validation constraints (`@NotBlank`, `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Email`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@DecimalMin`, `@Digits`, `@Pattern`) are appropriately used, aligning with the schema's data integrity requirements.
- `PrePersist` and `PreUpdate` lifecycle callbacks are used for `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps where applicable.

**Correction Made:**
- **`User.java`**: The `name` field was identified as non-nullable in the database schema but lacked an explicit `nullable = false` in its `@Column` annotation within the Java entity. This was corrected to ensure consistency and proper database schema generation/validation.

    **Before:**
    ```java
    @NotBlank(message = "Name is required")
    @Size(max = 255)
    private String name;
    ```

    **After:**
    ```java
    @NotBlank(message = "Name is required")
    @Size(max = 255)
    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String name;
    ```

## 3. Introduction of Enums for Type Safety

To enhance type safety, readability, and prevent invalid data, several fields with a fixed set of allowed values were converted from `String` types to custom Java `enum` types. A new package `com.enigmacamp.pawtner.constant` was created to house these enum definitions.

**Created Enum Classes:**
- `UserRole.java`
- `BusinessType.java`
- `BusinessStatus.java`
- `ProductCategory.java`
- `ServiceCategory.java`
- `OrderStatus.java`
- `BookingStatus.java`
- `PaymentStatus.java`

**Entity Classes Updated to Use Enums:**
- **`User.java`**: The `role` field now uses `UserRole` enum.
- **`Business.java`**: The `businessType` field now uses `BusinessType` enum, and `statusRealtime` uses `BusinessStatus` enum.
- **`Product.java`**: The `category` field now uses `ProductCategory` enum.
- **`Service.java`**: The `category` field now uses `ServiceCategory` enum.
- **`Order.java`**: The `status` field now uses `OrderStatus` enum.
- **`Booking.java`**: The `status` field now uses `BookingStatus` enum.
- **`Payment.java`**: The `status` field now uses `PaymentStatus` enum.

For each updated field, the `@Pattern` annotation (which was previously used for string-based validation) was removed, and `@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)` was added to ensure that JPA persists the enum values as their string names in the database.

## 4. Conclusion

The project's `README.md` provides a solid blueprint, and the existing entity classes are in good shape, closely mirroring the intended database design. The minor correction in `User.java` and the introduction of enums ensure even tighter alignment, improved type safety, and better maintainability.

The project is now well-prepared for the next development phases, such as implementing repositories, services, and controllers based on these entities.
